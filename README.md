NYC Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 Concentration Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) concentrations measured in New York City's wastewater facilities. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, specifically looking into how different variables correlate with the concentration of the virus.

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the NYC Open Data Portal and includes measurements of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations along with other features such as sample and test dates, names and abbreviations of Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs), population estimates served by each WRRF, and the testing technologies used.

Technical Approach
The project consists of the following tasks:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalization of dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Data Visualization: Implementing various visualization techniques to understand data distributions and relationships.
Regression Analysis: Applying linear regression to investigate the relationships between variables, such as population served and virus concentrations in the wastewater.
Tools and Technologies
Python: Primary programming language used for analysis.
Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library utilized for implementing regression analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries used for creating visualizations.
